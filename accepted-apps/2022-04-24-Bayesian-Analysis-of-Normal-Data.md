- PREREQUISITES:
    - Be familiar with the probability concepts of a random variable and conditional probability.
    - Know that, when making inference for Normally-distributed data with known standard deviation σ, a random sample is used to estimate the value of the mean, μ.
    - Be able to calculate and interpret confidence intervals for the mean of Normally-distributed data when the variance is known.
    - In the context of Bayesian statistics: 
        - be familiar with the concepts of prior distribution, hyperparameter, likelihood, and posterior distribution;
        - know that the prior distribution should reflect your initial belief about the true value of the parameter; 
        - be able to describe the roles of the hyperparameters in shaping the prior distribution.
- LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
In the context of binary data with success probability of p:
    - Given data and a Normal prior for μ, calculate by hand from a formula the parameters of the posterior distribution of μ.
    - Given data and a Normal prior for μ, order, from largest to smallest, the prior mean of μ, the sample mean, and the posterior mean of μ.
    - Given data and a Normal prior for μ, obtain the posterior mean and variance of μ using an online interactive resource.
    - Compare and contrast the interpretation of a frequentist (1−α)×100% confidence interval for μ with a Bayesian (1−α)×100% credible interval for μ.
    - Explain the impact that different prior distributions have on the posterior distribution.
