- PREREQUISITES:
    - Be familiar with the probability concepts of a random variable and conditional probability. 
    - Know that the Bernoulli distribution (which corresponds to a Binomial distribution with n = 1) is used to model data that can only take two values, also known as binary data.
    - Know that, when making inference for binary data, a random sample is used to estimate the value of the probability of success, p.
    - Be able to calculate and interpret approximate confidence intervals for the probability of success of binary data.
    - In the context of Bayesian statistics: 
        - be familiar with the concepts of prior distribution, hyperparameter, likelihood, and posterior distribution;
        - know that the prior distribution should reflect your initial belief about the true value of the parameter;
        - be able to describe the roles of the hyperparameters in shaping the prior distribution
- LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
In the context of binary data with success probability of p:
    - Given data and a Beta prior distribution for p, calculate by hand the parameters of the posterior distribution of p.
    - Given data and a Beta prior distribution for p, order, from largest to smallest, the prior mean of p, the sample mean, and the posterior mean of p.
    - Given data and a Beta prior, obtain the posterior mean and variance of p using an online interactive resource.
    - Compare and contrast the interpretation of a frequentist (1−α)×100% confidence interval for p with a Bayesian (1 − α) × 100% credible interval for p.
    - Explain the impact that different prior distributions have on the posterior distribution.
