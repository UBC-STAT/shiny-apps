- TITLE: Gaussian Mixture Model
- MAIN TOPIC: Exploring how parameters of a simple Gaussian mixture model changes the shape of the resulting distribution
- DESCRIPTION: The app allows user to change the 5 parameters of a simple Gaussian mixture model, and show simultaneously the changes in the components and the mixture distribution.

    - The students are asked before receiving the link to the app:
        - Can you write a simple mixture model that combines two normal distributions?
        - Can you draw an example of what it would look like?
    - After answering these questions, the students are given the link to the app and asked to change the values p, m1, and s1.
