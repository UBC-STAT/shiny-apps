- COURSES FOR USE: DSCI 100
- PREREQUISITES: 
    - Interpret scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms. 
    - Familiarity with the R programming language, and specifically with the dplyR and ggplot2 packages. 
    - You should be familiar with:
        - the pipe %>% and the mutate, filter, group_by, summarise, top_n, arrange, and different join functions. 
        - what aesthetics, geometries, and scales are in ggplot2, and how to add new layers to a ggplot object
- LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
    - Given a dataset and a question, select an appropriate plot type (scatter plot, line plot, bar plot or histogram) and use R to create a visualization that best answers the question
    - Given a visualization and a question, evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization and suggest improvements to better answer the question
    - Interpret the visualization in the context of the research question
    - Referring to the visualization, communicate the conclusions in nontechnical terms
    - Use the ggplot2 library in R to create and refine the above visualizations
- ACCOMPANYING ACTIVITY: none
