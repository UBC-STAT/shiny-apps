LICENSE YOUR WORK

If you would like to contribute to UBC-STAT/shiny-apps, you will need to choose a license.  We do this to keep everyone honest and, if possible, keep material as open as possible.  If you don't choose a license, then the default is that the license is exclusive - all yours. 

When you submit a resource, you can specify a license. If you don't, we will reach out to you.  We can help you (although we are not lawyers).

For code, we recommend using
-  the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
